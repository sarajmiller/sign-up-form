# Sign-Up-Form

I made this cute sign-up form as a mini-project while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form). This form is made using entirely HTML and CSS. I had a fun time making it very cute with this Minecraft theme, and it was good practice for understanding how to style forms.

## Font

I used the font [*Monocraft*](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft), a lovely font inspired by Minecraft. This is definitely one of my favorite fonts ever, and I love the retro/nostalgic vibe it gives.

## Next Steps

My next steps are to use JavaScript to develop the backend of this project. So far this page doesn't have any functionality other than being cute. This small project was a good learning experience, and I enjoyed it a lot. Hopefully I'll come back to it soon to add some more functionality.
